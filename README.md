# VRExperienceAGB

Current development: deep-tree focus, ensemble navigation, profile editing and a basic forest overview are implemented. See the [September 29 development record](docs/development-progress-2026-09-29.md).
An immersive explanation of adaptive gradient boosted decision trees for Meta Quest 3.

Explore a miniature forest, enter a tree, choose branches yourself, or follow a prepared customer profile. Watch each selected leaf contribute to the ensemble score in a twilight forest with luminous paths inspired by the existing AGB Grid Drive prototype.

**Status: implementation underway.** The synthetic model/session foundation and scene now have **111 passing EditMode tests and twelve passing PlayMode tests** in Unity 6000.6.3f1. The prior moonlit build installed and launched on Quest 3, and the user reported a successful first interaction test. The combined September 29 M3 candidate is ready for the [headset checklist](docs/m3-device-check-2026-09-29.md); device acceptance and actual performance measurements remain pending. Real AGB verification remains pending. Open `BoostingExperience/Assets/VRExperienceAGB/Scenes/OneTreeLearning.unity` and press Play for the mouse preview. Both manual exploration and deterministic prepared-profile playback remain available.

All project documentation, code, comments, identifiers, commit messages, and initial application copy are in English.

## Start here

1. Read [Experience scenarios](docs/experience-scenarios.md) for the product behavior.
2. Follow [Mac setup](docs/macos-setup.md) or [Windows setup](docs/windows-setup.md) to install the tools and open the existing Unity project.
3. Work through [Development plan](docs/development-plan.md), starting with the headset smoke test.
4. Use [Testing](docs/testing.md) to decide whether a milestone is complete.
5. Use the [M1–M6 delivery backlog](docs/backlog.md) for six epics, detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and required evidence.

The [model contract and solution design](docs/model-contract.md) explains AGB structure, scoring semantics, the fictional example, and the production verification backlog.

## Local checks available now

Run from the repository root:

```sh
bash scripts/check-mac.sh
python3 scripts/verify-examples.py
```

The first command reports local prerequisites and returns a nonzero status while required setup is missing. It does not install software or change configuration. The second checks the synthetic example predictions using only the Python standard library. It does not verify Pega scoring or Unity code.

The environment checker uses `BoostingExperience/` and its pinned Editor version. Set `VRAGB_PROJECT_DIR` only when intentionally checking another project. Local prerequisite checks pass; headset behavior still requires the smoke test.

## Agreed technology

Unity 6, C#, URP, Unity OpenXR Plugin, and Meta XR Core/Interaction SDK. The target is a standalone Android ARM64 application on Quest 3. Controllers are the initial input method. The first release works offline with bundled demonstration data.

The user selected the installed **Unity 6000.6.3f1 Apple Silicon** baseline on 2026-09-28. Keep that version; no Editor migration is planned. Open `BoostingExperience/` in Unity Hub and manage Git from this repository root. Package manifest, lock, settings, assets, and their metadata belong to this repository. See [Toolchain](docs/toolchain.md) for tested limits and [repository consolidation](docs/repository-consolidation.md) for preserved history and recovery.

## First deliverable

A Quest user can inspect one seven-node tree, choose a branch, reach a leaf, go back without double-counting its contribution, and replay the same tree with a prepared profile. The scene includes a small but coherent piece of the final forest environment.

The existing `AGBVisualizer` is a reference implementation. This repository does not modify it or assume that its display calculations are a verified production scorer.

The repository is local. Creating a remote, publishing a build, and selecting an open-source license are separate decisions.
